## 4.5 Offset Table Retrieval Instructions

To retrieve the full offset table, please ensure that you run `generate_offsets.exe`. Hardcoding values for the offset table is not permitted as it could lead to inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the protocol implementation.

## 8.5 JSON Error Handling Pending

The implementation of JSON error handling is currently on hold. We will defer this feature until the `CPP-parsers` repository adds the necessary error APIs that will allow for proper handling of JSON-related errors.
